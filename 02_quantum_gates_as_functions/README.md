## What Problem Are We Solving?
What are quantum gates if we think like software engineers?

## Classical Intuition
In programming, functions take input and return output.

## Quantum Idea (No Math)
Quantum gates are functions that transform the state of a qubit.

## Code Walkthrough
We apply different gates to a qubit and observe how its state changes.

## Output & Interpretation
Different gates produce different probability distributions.

## Key Takeaway
Quantum gates behave like pure functions applied to a probabilistic state.
