## What Problem Are We Solving?

Why do quantum programs give different outputs each time,
and why does real quantum hardware behave worse than simulators?

## Classical Intuition

Classical programs are deterministic.
The same input always produces the same output.

## Quantum Reality 

Quantum programs produce probability distributions.
Measurement samples from those distributions.

Noise changes the distribution itself.

## What This Module Demonstrates

- Measurement variability
- Repeated execution (shots)
- Ideal vs noisy behavior
- Why averaging matters

## Key Takeaway

Quantum programs must be analyzed statistically,
not by single execution results.
