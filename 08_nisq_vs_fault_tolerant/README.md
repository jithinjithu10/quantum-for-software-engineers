## What Problem Are We Solving?

Why do most quantum demos look small and experimental,
while theoretical quantum algorithms promise massive speedups?

## Two Eras of Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is divided into two distinct eras:

- Near-Term (NISQ)
- Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing

They have very different capabilities and constraints.

## Near-Term Quantum Computing (NISQ)

Characteristics:
- Noisy qubits
- Short coherence times
- Limited circuit depth
- No full error correction

What it is good for:
- Research
- Algorithm prototyping
- Hybrid classical–quantum workflows
- Small-scale experiments

## Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing

Characteristics:
- Logical qubits built from many physical qubits
- Active error correction
- Long-running circuits
- Reliable computation

What it enables:
- Large-scale algorithms
- Deep circuits
- Theoretical speedups (e.g., factoring, simulation)

## Key Takeaway

Near-term quantum computing explores possibilities.
Fault-tolerant quantum computing delivers guarantees.
