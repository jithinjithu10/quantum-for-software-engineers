## Notes

- NISQ devices explore, they do not deliver guarantees.
- Fault tolerance is a prerequisite for most famous algorithms.
- Logical qubits matter more than physical counts.
- Error correction overhead dominates scaling.
- Most timelines are hardware-limited, not algorithm-limited.
- Hybrid algorithms exist because of NISQ constraints.
