## What Problem Are We Solving?
What exactly is a qubit when you think like a programmer?

## Classical Intuition
A classical bit is always either 0 or 1.

## Quantum Idea (No Math)
A qubit can exist in a mixed state and only becomes 0 or 1 when measured.

## Code Walkthrough
We simulate qubit behavior using probability and randomness.

## Output & Interpretation
Running the program multiple times produces different outputs.

## Key Takeaway
A qubit behaves like a probabilistic state object, not a fixed value.
