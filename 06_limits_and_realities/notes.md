## Notes

- Quantum scaling is limited by physics, not algorithms.
- Error correction is mandatory for real advantage.
- Noise compounds exponentially.
- Circuit depth is the real bottleneck.
- Near-term devices are research tools, not production systems.
- Most failures are expected behavior, not bugs.
