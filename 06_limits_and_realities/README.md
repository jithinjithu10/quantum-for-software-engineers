## What Problem Are We Solving?

Why can’t quantum computers replace classical computers today,
despite their theoretical power?

## Common Misconception

Quantum computers are often seen as universally faster
or as replacements for classical machines.

This is incorrect.

## Reality (No Math)

Quantum computers:
- are extremely sensitive to noise
- lose information quickly (decoherence)
- require statistical interpretation
- work well only for specific problems

## What This Module Covers

- Noise and error accumulation
- Decoherence and instability
- Limited qubit counts
- Why most problems see no quantum advantage
- Why hybrid (classical + quantum) systems dominate today

## Key Takeaway

Quantum computing is not a general replacement for classical computing.
It is a specialized tool for specific problem classes.
