## What Problem Are We Solving?
Why does entanglement feel different from normal correlation?

## Classical Intuition
Two classical variables can be correlated, but they still exist independently.

## Quantum Idea
Entangled qubits share a single state.
Measuring one immediately determines the other.

## Code Walkthrough
We simulate two entangled qubits and show how their measurements are linked.

## Output & Interpretation
Even when measured separately, outcomes always match.

## Key Takeaway
Entanglement means the system must be described as a whole, not as parts.
